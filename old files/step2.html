var board = new WGo.Board(document.getElementById("board"), {
    width: 600,
});
However we would like to see only a part of the board, so we call constructor with parameter section.



var board = new WGo.Board(document.getElementById("board"), {
    width: 600,
    section: {
        top: 12,
        left: 6,
        right: -0.5,
        bottom: -0.5
    }
});
